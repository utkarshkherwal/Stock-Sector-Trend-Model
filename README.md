# Stock Sector Trend Model
The Stock Sector Trend Model is a tool that looks at how different groups of stocks (called sectors, like tech, energy, or healthcare) perform over time. By tracking their ups and downs using stock market data, this model helps identify which phase the economy might be in — whether it's growing, slowing down, or recovering. This can give useful insights to investors, students, or anyone curious about how stock markets reflect bigger economic trends.

# What Is This Project?
This model relies on the concept of sector rotation, which means different sectors of the stock market tend to perform better or worse depending on where the economy is in its cycle. By observing which sector ETFs are leading or lagging, the model estimates the most likely current phase of the business cycle.

#Economic Theory
This model is based on Sector Rotation Theory, which includes the following key ideas:

The economy follows a recurring pattern known as the business cycle.

Different sectors of the market perform differently at various stages of the cycle.

Investors shift their money into sectors that are expected to perform well in the upcoming phase.

The performance of sectors can signal economic turning points before official data confirms them.

This theory was popularized by Sam Stovall of S&P Global, who developed a widely used visual map connecting sector performance to economic cycles.

## The Four Phases of the Economic Cycle

| **Economic Phase** | **Simple Explanation**                           | **Common Economic Signs**                                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recovery**       | The economy begins to improve after a downturn   | Growth returns, unemployment falls, interest rates are low             |
| **Expansion**      | Strong and steady economic growth                | High consumer demand, rising wages and inflation                       |
| **Slowdown**       | Growth is still positive but begins to slow      | Lower business activity, rising caution, possibly high inflation       |
| **Recession**      | The economy contracts or shrinks                 | Falling output, job losses, reduced consumer and business spending     |

# Sector Rotation Across the Cycle
Investors adjust their strategies based on where they believe the economy is headed:

Recovery: Focus shifts to sectors likely to benefit first from a rebound, such as Technology and Consumer Discretionary.

Expansion: Capital flows into sectors tied to business growth like Financials and Industrials.

Slowdown: Attention moves to sectors providing essential goods and services like Healthcare and Consumer Staples.

Recession: Defensive sectors like Utilities and Consumer Staples become preferred due to their steady demand.

## Sector Performance Example by Phase
| **Economic Phase** | **Strong Sectors**               | **Reason for Strength**                                                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recovery**       | Technology, Consumer Discretionary | These sectors benefit first as consumer and business spending picks up           |
| **Expansion**      | Financials, Industrials           | Increased lending, investment, and corporate activity                             |
| **Slowdown**       | Healthcare, Consumer Staples      | Steady demand for essential goods and services                                    |
| **Recession**      | Utilities, Consumer Staples       | Consumers cut back, but basic services remain in demand                           |


# Why Sector ETF Performance Signals the Economic Phase
This model uses relative strength and recent performance of sector ETFs to identify how investors are positioning themselves. If Technology or Discretionary ETFs are outperforming, it suggests confidence and likely expansion. If Utilities or Staples are leading, it may point to market defensiveness, indicating a slowdown or recession.

Because financial markets often react in advance, sector performance offers early insights into shifts in the economic cycle—much ahead of official data releases like GDP or employment figures.

# Who Can Use This Model?
Analysts seeking a quick view of the economic cycle

Investors looking to align their portfolio with market conditions

Economics students exploring how financial markets reflect economic fundamentals

Researchers using real-time financial indicators for macroeconomic analysis

This model provides a simple, evidence-based tool for interpreting market sentiment and economic direction through sector behavior.
