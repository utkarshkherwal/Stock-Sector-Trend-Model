# Stock Sector Trend Model
The Stock Sector Trend Model is a tool that looks at how different groups of stocks (called sectors, like tech, energy, or healthcare) perform over time. By tracking their ups and downs using stock market data, this model helps identify which phase the economy might be in â€” whether it's growing, slowing down, or recovering. This can give useful insights to investors, students, or anyone curious about how stock markets reflect bigger economic trends.

# What Is This Project?
This model relies on the concept of sector rotation, which means different sectors of the stock market tend to perform better or worse depending on where the economy is in its cycle. By observing which sector ETFs are leading or lagging, the model estimates the most likely current phase of the business cycle.

#Economic Theory
This model is based on Sector Rotation Theory, which includes the following key ideas:

The economy follows a recurring pattern known as the business cycle.

Different sectors of the market perform differently at various stages of the cycle.

Investors shift their money into sectors that are expected to perform well in the upcoming phase.

The performance of sectors can signal economic turning points before official data confirms them.

This theory was popularized by Sam Stovall of S&P Global, who developed a widely used visual map connecting sector performance to economic cycles.

# The Four Phases of the Economic Cycle
Economic Phase	Simple Explanation	Common Economic Signs
Recovery	The economy begins to improve after a downturn	Growth returns, unemployment falls, interest rates are low
Expansion	Strong and steady economic growth	High consumer demand, rising wages and inflation
Slowdown	Growth is still positive but begins to slow	Lower business activity, rising caution, possibly high inflation
Recession	The economy contracts or shrinks	Falling output, job losses, reduced consumer and business spending
